# Minimal boilerplate with Browsersync and Hot Module Replacement for Vue

Can be used to quickly start writing and live previewing a Vue component.

To install runn `npm install`. Then start the server with `npm run dev`.

If you change `public/index.html`, Browsersync will reload the page. If you change the Vue Single File Component in `resources/js/components/ExampleComponent.vue`, the page will not reload, but the component will be replaced, and even state would persist ("Hot Module Replacement").
